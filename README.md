Kubei is a vulnerabilities scanning tool that allows users to get an accurate and immediate risk assessment of their kubernetes clusters. Kubei scans all images that are being used in a Kubernetes cluster, including images of application pods and system pods. It doesn’t scan the entire image registries and doesn’t require preliminary integration with CI/CD pipelines. 

It is a configurable tool which allows users to define the scope of the scan (target namespaces), the speed, and the vulnerabilities level of interest.

It provides a graphical UI which allows the viewer to identify where and what should be replaced, in order to mitigate the discovered vulnerabilities. 


## Prerequisites 
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fakpsgit%2Fkubei.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fakpsgit%2Fkubei?ref=badge_shield)


1. A Kubernetes cluster is ready, and kubeconfig ( `~/.kube/config`) is properly configured for the target cluster.

## Configurations 

1. The file `deploy/kubei.yaml` is used to deploy and configure Kubei on your cluster.

1. Set the scan scope. Set the `IGNORE_NAMESPACES` env variable to ignore specific namespaces. Set `TARGET_NAMESPACE` to scan a specific namespace, or leave empty to scan all namespaces.

2. Set the scan speed. Expedite scanning by running parallel scanners. Set the `MAX_PARALLELISM` env variable for the maximum number of simultaneous scanners.

3. Set severity level threshold. Vulnerabilities with severity level higher than or equal to `SEVERITY_THRESHOLD` threshold will be reported. Supported levels are `Unknown`, `Negligible`, `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Critical`, `Defcon1`. Default is `Medium`.

## Usage 

1. Run the following command to deploy Kubei on the cluster:

    `
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Portshift/kubei/master/deploy/kubei.yaml
    `

2. Run the following command to verify that Kubi is up and running:

    `
    kubectl -n kubei get pod -lapp=kubei
    `

3. Then, port forwarding into the Kubei webapp via the following command:

    `
    kubectl -n kubei port-forward $(kubectl -n kubei get pods -lapp=kubei -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8080 
    `    

4. In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080/view/ , and then click  'GO' to run a scan.

5. To check the state of Kubei, and the progress of ongoing scans, run the following command:

    `
	kubectl -n kubei logs $(kubectl -n kubei get pods -lapp=kubei -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')  
    `

6. Refresh the page (http://localhost:8080/view/) to update the results.

## Limitations 

1. Supports Kubernetes Image Manifest V 2, Schema 2 (https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/). It will fail to scan on earlier versions.
 
2. The CVE database will update once a day.
